# 🎬 Reels App — Flutter

A production-grade Instagram/TikTok-style short video reels app built with **Flutter**, **Firebase Firestore**, **GetX** state management, and **Clean Architecture** following **SOLID principles**.

---

## 📱 Demo

> Scroll through short videos fetched from Firebase Firestore, with seamless preloading, video caching, like toggle, and error handling.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 **Vertical scroll** through short video reels (like Instagram/TikTok)
- ☁️ **Firebase Firestore** — fetch video metadata (URL, username, likes, caption)
- ⚡ **Preload 3–4 videos ahead** for seamless playback
- 💾 **Video caching** via `flutter_cache_manager` — no re-downloading
- ▶️ **Auto-play / pause** based on scroll position
- 🔇 **Audio bleed prevention** — previous video muted immediately on scroll
- 🔒 **Scroll lock** — user cannot scroll until current video is ready
- ❤️ **Like toggle** with optimistic update + Firestore sync
- 📵 **Error handling** — 403, 404, network errors shown with retry button
- ♻️ **Memory management** — disposes controllers far from current index
- 📱 **iOS & Android** supported

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** with strict layer separation. Dependencies point inward only.

## 🧱 SOLID Principles Applied

| Principle | Where |
|---|---|
| **S** — Single Responsibility | `GetReelsUseCase` only fetches. `ReelController` only manages UI state. `ReelRemoteDataSource` only talks to Firestore. |
| **O** — Open/Closed | New use cases added in new files without modifying existing ones. |
| **L** — Liskov Substitution | `ReelRepositoryImpl` fully satisfies `ReelRepository` contract anywhere. |
| **I** — Interface Segregation | `ReelRemoteDataSource` has only 2 focused methods — no bloated interfaces. |
| **D** — Dependency Inversion | `ReelController` depends on `GetReelsUseCase` abstraction, not concrete Firestore calls. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK `>=3.0.0`
- Dart SDK `>=3.0.0`
- Firebase project (already connected)
- Android Studio / Xcode

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reels-app.git
cd reels-app
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**3. Firebase setup**

Your project is already connected to Firebase. Just make sure `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) are in their correct locations:

```
android/app/google-services.json
ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

**4. iOS setup**

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

**5. Run the app**

```bash
flutter run
```

## ⚙️ iOS Configuration

Add the following to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for video playback.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for video playback.</string>
```

Add the following to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import AVFoundation

// Inside didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(
    .playback, mode: .moviePlayback, options: []
)
try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true)
```

---

## ⚙️ Android Configuration

Add the following to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` inside `<application>`:

```xml
android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
```

## 📐 How Video Preloading Works

```
Current index: 3

[ 1 ]  disposed (too far back)
[ 2 ]  kept in memory, paused, muted
[ 3 ]  ▶ playing  ← current
[ 4 ]  preloaded, paused, muted
[ 5 ]  preloaded, paused, muted
[ 6 ]  preloaded, paused, muted
[ 7 ]  not loaded yet
```

- Scroll is **locked** until the current video's controller is initialized
- Previous video is **muted immediately** on page change to prevent audio bleed
- Controllers **beyond range** are disposed to free memory
- Videos are **cached locally** so re-visiting a reel plays instantly

## 🐛 Error Handling

| Error | Shown To User |
|---|---|
| HTTP 403 | "Access denied (403)." |
| HTTP 404 | "Video not found (404)." |
| HTTP 500 | "Server error (500)." |
| No internet | "No internet connection." |
| Invalid URL | "Invalid video URL." |
| ExoPlayer / format error | "Video format not supported." |

All errors show a **Tap to retry** button. Tapping clears the error, resets retry count, disposes the broken controller, and re-initializes from scratch.
